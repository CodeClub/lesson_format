# Contributing to our Curriculum

## Introduction

This guide explains how to contribute to our curriculum. You can:
+ Suggest amendments and improvements to our projects;
+ Write new projects;
+ Translate our projects into other languages.

You donâ€™t have to use this method to contribute. If you prefer, you can also email us with your contribution at projects@codeclub.org.uk.

## Installing the lesson_format tool

This repository allows you to create a local copy of the projects, which is useful for checking your changes before you contribute. Instructions on how instal the lesson_format tool are [here](https://github.com/CodeClub/lesson_format/blob/master/README.md).

## Downloading the projects

In the terminal, go to the folder where you downloaded the lesson_format tool:

```
cd lesson_format
```

Download the projects by typing:

```
make clone
```

You should now have a `lessons` folder, containing the project resources.

## Adding Your Contribution

You can now:
+ Make amendments and improvements to projects;
+ [Write new projects](https://github.com/CodeClub/lesson_format/blob/master/FORMATTING.md);
+ [Translate our projects into other languages](https://github.com/CodeClub/scratch-curriculum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
(these instructions will be improved soon!)
