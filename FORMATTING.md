# Lesson Formatting

## Code Club Markdown

We use the GitHub flavoured Markdown that pandoc understands, in particular the format `markdown_github+header_attributes+yaml_metadata_block+inline_code_attributes`. Pandoc's documentation covers these options and more http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html

In particular:

- Each markdown file can begin with a YAML header
- Headers in markdown `# Header` can be annotated with styles `# {.style}`
- Fenced Code blocks can specify their language
- Inline code sections can too

For Example

    ---
    title: An example Markdown File
    ...

    # Introduction {.intro}

    ```scratch
    when FLAG clicked
      move 10 steps
    ```

## Headers in Markdown files.

Each markdown file should contain a YAML block, with the title set. For lessons, the header should contain a title, and level.

An example lesson header looks like this:

```
---
title: Felix and Herbert
level: Level 1
language: en-GB
stylesheet: scratch
embeds: "*.png"
materials: "Felix-and-Herbert.sb"
note: "notes for club leaders.md"
...

Rest of markdown file ...
```

- The language is optional, but useful.
- The stylesheet is needed for scratch worksheets.
- Embeds is a file, or a list of files for images used inside the document
- Materials is a file, or list of files of things that accompany the lesson (e.g scratch files)
- Note is the filename of the optional notes for volunteers.
- Level is the difficulty of the project.

Any file name is taken to be relative to the markdown file's directory, file names can also be globbed, i.e "*.png".

The lesson formatter parses these headers for building the static pages and indexes, however they can also be defined in the Term Manifest, which is detailed later.

## Code Club Markdown Annotations

Each lesson begins with an introduction,

- Mark up introduction headers `# Intro {.intro}` (always a h1)

Each lesson is broken down into steps

- Mark up steps with `# Step 1 {.activity}` (always a h1)

Each step has a series of activities, in a list.

- Before each list, use a subheader `## Activity checklist {.check}` (always a h2)

Each step can have things to optionally try.

- Use `## Things to try {.try}` (always h2)

Each step can also have challenges too.

- Use `## Challenge {.challenge}` (always a h2)

A note to save:

- Use `## Save Your Project {.save}` (always a h2)

A note to test:

- Use `## Test Your Project {.flag}` (always a h2)

### Page breaks

Sometimes itâ€™s necessary to force a page break in the generated PDF. Adding `.new-page` to a heading will force the heading onto a new page.

- e.g. `## Things to try {.try .new-page}` (this can be used with any type of heading.)

## Scratchblocks

We use the scratchblocks2 library, and PhantomJS to render scratch blocks as png files.

Scratch blocks inside lessons must follow the syntax set out here: http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin/Syntax

You can test your syntax here, http://blob8108.github.io/scratchblocks2/, (remembering to set the language!).

We use `scratch`, or `blocks` as the name of the language, for example, in markdown:

    Some paragraph

    ```scratch
    when FLAG clicked
      move 10 steps
    ```

    Another paragraph
